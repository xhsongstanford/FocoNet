# FocoNet

This is a transformer-based neural network to solve for the focal mechanism by combining the first-motion polarities, S/P amplitude ratios, SNRs from a set of stations.
Code will be uploaded after we publish a peer-reviewed paper.

FocoNet structure and the workflow to deterine a focal mechanism:
